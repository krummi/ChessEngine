### Ziggy - v0.7
###

Description
===========

Yet another chess engine. Created with a *little* help and inspiration from other chess engines
such as CPW, Mediocre, TSCP, Glaurung, Stockfish, Fruit, and inspirations and guides from people
like Fritz Reul (Loop) and Ed Schr√∂der (Rebel).

To be done
==========
    # C++'d - I guess. :(
    ! Search extensions.
    ! Deterministic mode.
    ! Some actual parsing of UCI's options.
    # Better transposition entries.
    # Better transposition table (with generations, clusters of entries, etc)
    # Only generate 'good captures' in quiescence.
    # Dynamic R value in Null-Moves.
    ! Killer moves
    ? Contempt factor
    # Endgame tablebases.

Usage instructions
==================

UCI mode:
    java -jar ziggy.jar

Benchmark mode:
    java -jar ziggy.jar <bench> <type=perft | depth | suite> <file=suite/fen file>
                        [time=time for each position (s)] [depth=fixed depth for each position]

Both modes:
    In both UCI and benchmark mode there are a number of settings which can be adjusted
    as requested.

    Setting                           Default    Description
    --------------------------------- -------- --------------------------------------------------
    mc=<on | off>                     on       Turns Multi-Cut on or off.
    |   mc_cutoffs=int                3        Sets MCs C param.
    |   mc_expand=int                 10       Sets MCs E param.
    |   mc_reduction=int              2        Sets MCs R param.
    |   mc_piece=<on | off>           off      Turns MCs piece-check on or off.
    nm=<on | off>                     on       Turns NMs pruning on or off.
    |   nm_reduction=int              2        Sets NMs R param.
    lmr=<on | off>                    on       Turns LMR on or off.
    |   lmr_fdm=int                   4        Sets the no. of full depth moves in LMR.
    asp=int                           50       Sets the size of the aspiration window.

Examples:
    java -jar ziggy.jar bench type=suite file=wac.txt time=10
    -- Will run the test-suite Win At Chess, with a time constraints of 10 seconds per position.

    java -jar ziggy.jar bench type=suite file=wac.txt depth=7
    -- Same, but with a fixed depth of 7 instead of time constraints.

    java -jar ziggy.jar bench type=suite file=wac.txt depth=7 lmr=off nm=off mc=off
    -- Same, but without LMR, NM- and MC pruning.
