### Ziggy - v0.6
###

Description:
============

Yet another chess engine. Created with a *little* help and inspiration from other chess engines
such as CPW, Mediocre, TSCP, Glaurung, Stockfish, Fruit, and inspirations and guides from people
like Fritz Reul (Loop) and Ed Schröder (Rebel).

Usage instructions:
===================

UCI mode:
    java -jar ziggy.jar

Benchmark mode:
    java -jar ziggy.jar <bench> <type=perft | depth | suite> <file=suite/fen file> [time=time for each position (s)] [depth=fixed depth for each position]

Both:
    Multi-Cut, Null-Moves and Late-Move Reductions are by-default enabled, but can be disabled in both modes by:

    mc=off  (turns Multi-Cut off)
    nm=off  (turns Null-Moves off)
    lmr=off (turns Late-Move Reductions off)

Examples:
    java -jar ziggy.jar bench type=suite file=wac.txt time=10    <- Will run the test-suite Win At Chess, with a time constraints ("umhugsunartími?") of 10 seconds per position.
    java -jar ziggy.jar bench type=suite file=wac.txt depth=7    <- Same, but with a fixed depth of 7 instead of time constraints.
